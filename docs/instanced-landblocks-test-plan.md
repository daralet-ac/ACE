# Instanced landblocks: test plan

What to run, and what to expect, to trust the instancing system on a live server. Read [instanced-landblocks.md](instanced-landblocks.md) first for how it works and what every command does.

- **Build under test:** branch `feat/instanced-landblocks`, from the commit that adds this file. It includes the two fixes that came out of writing and running this plan: "a player can't walk out of an instance" and "fellowship XP, pets and house purchases don't cross into instances".
- **Priorities:** **P0** must pass before instances are used on the live server. **P1** should pass; a failure needs a decision. **P2** is worth a look, or informational.
- **Where to run it:** a development server with a copy of the shard and world databases. Take a backup first. Some tests kill the server and edit the database.

## 1. What is covered already, and what is not

**Already covered by automated tests** (`dotnet test apps/server-tests`, 135 tests, no database or DATs needed): templates, rings and the `instances.json` parser; the instance registry, timers and `FindOrRegister`; instance-only landblocks and `CanEnter`; the ids the statics of an instance get, and the translation of world-database guids; cell identity across instances; which objects can be moved; the description helpers; the training academies (where new characters start, and which templates are personal). In a checkout without a database or DAT config 129 pass. The 6 that fail (`Sphere_CollideWithPoint`, `Sphere_SlideSphere`, `CanParseStarterGearJson`, `DatabaseManager_Initialize`, `WorldManager_Initialize`, `CommandManager_Initialize`) fail the same way on the commit before instancing existed, because they need a database, DATs and config. On your machine some of them may pass.

**Checked once against the real DATs, with no database** (152 checks, a console harness that is not in the repository): physics isolation between instances, landblock loading and adjacency, ids and teardown, islands with rings, solid edges, the world-guid lookup, and moving objects between instances.

**Not covered by anything, so this plan is where they are tested:** every real player flow (login, logout, death, teleport, portals, trade, fellowship), the commands, the fellowship-dungeon path, the database, parallel landblock ticking, load, and the persistent world itself (the physics change touches it).

**Where the bugs are most likely:** (1) the player flows, which have never run live; (2) the change to shared physics, because it can affect the persistent world; (3) parallel landblock ticking; (4) systems that look at positions instead of landblocks, which do not know about instances (three were found while writing this plan, so expect more); (5) the database.

## 2. Setup

**Accounts.** `ADMIN` (Admin level), and ordinary players `A`, `B`, `C`. Two clients are enough for the smoke test, and four are better for the full plan. Give `A`/`B` enough level for the dungeon used in section G.

**Baseline, before anything else.** Restart the server, log in `ADMIN`, and record `/serverstatus` (memory, threads, loaded and dormant landblocks), and the database counts from appendix B.

**Settings used by the tests**

| Setting | How | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `instance_empty_timeout_minutes` | `/modifylong instance_empty_timeout_minutes 1` (default 15) | Lifecycle tests. Never set it to 0: an instance nobody has entered yet would be deleted at once. |
| `capstone_instanced_dungeons` | `/modifystring capstone_instanced_dungeons Glenden Wood Dungeon` (comma separated; empty by default) | Section G |
| `starter_academy_instances` | `/modifybool starter_academy_instances false` (true by default) | Section N |
| `Server.Threading.MultiThreadedLandblockGroupTicking` and `...MultiThreadedLandblockGroupPhysicsTicking` | `Config.js`, both `true` in `Config.js.example` | Run the P0 tests once with both `true` and once with both `false` (J1, J2) |
| `instances.json` | The server reads the copy that sits next to `ACE.Server.exe` (`dist/apps/server/net8.0/instances.json`), and it is read once, at startup. Edit that copy, then restart. A build only puts the one from `apps/server` there when there is none, so it never overwrites yours (delete it and build to get the default back). The shipped file lists `aerlinthe` (210 landblocks), `test-holtburg` (9) and `test-big` (25), all for testing and none instance only; a copy made before they were added does not have them. | Sections A and F. Samples in appendix C. |

**Logs.** Console (Information and up) and the JSON file set in `appsettings.json` (`c:\ACE\Logs\ace-<date>.log`, every line is a JSON object with the rendered text). Search for `[INSTANCE]`, `NullReference`, `cross-thread`, `REPORT THIS` and `Fixed invisible attacker`. Appendix A says which `[INSTANCE]` lines are expected. `Unable to find object_id ... in Cell` lines are old noise from the server DAT, which lacks some cells that the world database uses (see the row on interior statics in section 7; `server-dat-broken-landblocks.txt` is from before the dat was rewritten on 2026-09-20), not from instancing.

**Memory readings.** `/serverstatus` "MB used" is the process's private memory (`Process.PrivateMemorySize64`), and the server runs with Server GC and `RetainVM` (`ACE.Server.csproj`), so memory that was freed stays committed for a while and comes back on the GC's own schedule: on 2026-09-21 it took about ten minutes after five instances closed (1,372 MB at the peak, 1,300 MB for seven minutes, then about 1,165 MB), and a few minutes when a build took the machine's free RAM (about 380 MB given back). It cannot tell a leak from the GC holding memory. To look for a leak run `/forcegc`, then `/gcstatus`, and compare `GC.GetTotalMemory` (the live managed heap): growth that repeats with every cycle is a leak.

**Record results** in the table in appendix D.

## 3. Smoke test (P0, about 45 minutes, `ADMIN` + `A` + `B`)

Run this on every new build. If any step fails, stop.

| # | Do | Expect |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | Start the server with the shipped `instances.json`, which lists `aerlinthe`, `test-holtburg` and `test-big`. `/instance list`. | No `[INSTANCE]` errors, and one `Island <name>: ...` line for each: `aerlinthe` 210 landblocks (54 of them ring), `test-holtburg` 9 (8 of them ring), `test-big` 25 (16 of them ring). "Instance templates (3)", "Open instances (0)". |
| S2 | Stand somewhere outdoors with `A` next to you. `/instance here 1`, then `/instance info`, `/myloc`. | You arrive at the same spot. `info` says instance N, inside the instance. `myloc` has an `Instance:` line. `A` does not see you and you do not see `A`. |
| S3 | `/create` an item and a monster next to you. | `A` (persistent world) sees neither. The monster attacks you, not `A`. |
| S4 | Run to the edge of the 3 x 3 landblocks, and keep pushing on past it for 30 seconds. Then `/myloc`. | You are stopped at the edge: about a second after crossing it the client is put back, and again each time you push on. `Location` and `Physics` in `/myloc` are both inside the block and agree to within a few metres. No `[INSTANCE] ... which is not part of instance` warning in the log. |
| S5 | `/instance enter N A`, then `/instance info A`, then `/instance leave A`. | `A` is sent in, sees the monster, and is sent out. The audit channel shows both. |
| S6 | `/instance enter N A` again, and let the monster kill `A`. | No corpse. `A` keeps every item. Vitae applies as usual. `A` respawns at the bound lifestone: in the persistent world if it is outside the instance's landblocks, in the instance if it is inside them (E5). |
| S7 | `/instance enter N A` a third time. `A` tries to drop an item and to split a stack onto the ground. Then `/instance leave A`. | "You can't drop items here." Nothing dropped. |
| S8 | `/instance leave`, wait one minute, `/instance list`. | The instance shows "empty for x of 1 min", then is gone. Log: `[INSTANCE] Deleted instance N`. `/serverstatus` landblock count is back to the baseline. |
| S9 | `/instance open test-holtburg` (it comes in the shipped file), walk into the ring. | Message "You can go no further that way." and you are back inside the island within a second or two. |
| S10 | `A` logs out inside an instance, then logs in. | `A` is in the persistent world at the return position. `/instance list` shows 0 players. |
| S11 | Run appendix B query 1 (ephemeral ids). | 0 rows. |
| S12 | Persistent world: `B` dies to a monster, drops an item, recalls. | Corpse and drops as before. Everything as before. |

## 4. Full test matrix

### A. Startup and `instances.json`

| ID | P | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | P0 | Start with the shipped file, which lists three islands. | Three `[INSTANCE] Island ...` lines (`aerlinthe` 210 landblocks, `test-holtburg` 9, `test-big` 25), and no error. |
| A2 | P1 | Delete `instances.json` from the output folder, start. | `[INSTANCE] There is no ...instances.json, so there are no islands`. Server starts normally. |
| A3 | P0 | Look for `test-holtburg` (it comes in the shipped file, and appendix C has its text) in the startup log and in `/instance list`. | `[INSTANCE] Island test-holtburg: 9 landblocks, 8 of them ring`. `/instance list` shows it with "9 landblock(s), 8 of them ring". |
| A4 | P1 | One mistake at a time, each next to a good island (table below). | The error is logged as `[INSTANCE] <path>: island 'x': <text>`, that island is missing from `/instance list`, the good island loads, and the server starts. |
| A5 | P2 | Comments, trailing commas, property names in capitals (`"Name"`), and `"return": { }`. Then `"instanceOnly": "true"` as text, and `"return": { "x": 1 }` (something in it, but no cell). | The first four are accepted, and an empty `return` means the sanctuary. The last two are rejected and the island is left out: `instanceOnly` in quotes is text, not a boolean (`instanceOnly has to be true or false`), and only that island is left out, and a `return` needs a cell (`return: it has no cell`). |
| A6 | P1 | Put a landblock of an instance-only island on the server's landblock pre-load list, if you use one. | One `[INSTANCE] Something asked the persistent world for landblock XXXX ...` error at startup, the landblock is not loaded. Take it off the list. |

Mistakes for A4 and the text to expect: no `name` (`it has no name`), a name used twice (`another island has the same name`), a name starting `capstone:` (`are for the capstone dungeons`), `instanceOnly` missing (`instanceOnly has to be set`), landblock `"E7"` (`is not a landblock`), no landblocks (`it has no landblocks`), entry in the ring or outside (`not one of the island's landblocks`; the ring is one landblock outside the island, and for a rectangle the corners are inside it: `aerlinthe` is written from B3F3 to BFE8, so B3F3 is an island landblock and `0xB2F3001D` is the ring), no entry (`entry: it is missing`), a cell that is not eight hex digits (`is not a cell`), `qw` 0 (`the rotation is empty`), `return` inside the island (`inside the island`), `return` in an instance-only island (`only exists as an instance`), more than 400 landblocks (`400`), `bufferRing` 5 (`bufferRing has to be from 0 to 4`), `bufferRing` as text (`bufferRing has to be a whole number`), `landblocks` as text (`landblocks has to be a list`), text that is not JSON (`The file can't be read`).

### B. Lifecycle

| ID | P | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | P0 | `/instance here 0`. | "Opened instance N (1 landblock(s))...". You arrive at the same spot. `list` shows "N: here-XXXX - 1 player(s) in it". |
| B2 | P0 | `/instance leave`. | Back at the spot you left from. `/instance info` says instance 0. `list` shows "empty for x of y min". |
| B3 | P1 | `/instance here 3` and `/instance here 9`. | 49 landblocks each (9 is clamped to 3). All loaded, no errors. Note how long it took. Landblock count in `/serverstatus` is up by 49. |
| B4 | P0 | Timeout 1 minute. Enter, leave, watch `/instance list`. | Deleted after one minute. Log `[INSTANCE] Deleted instance N`. The landblock count returns to the baseline. Memory: run `/forcegc`, then `/gcstatus`, and compare `GC.GetTotalMemory` before and after; repeat 10 times and it does not keep growing (not `/serverstatus` "MB used", see Setup). |
| B5 | P0 | `/instance close N` with `A` inside. | `A` is sent to the return position (or sanctuary). The instance is gone within a couple of ticks. Closing it again says "There is no instance". |
| B6 | P1 | `/instance open test-holtburg` from two accounts. | Both are in the same instance. `open test-holtburg new` makes another one. |
| B7 | P1 | `/instance enter 0`, `enter 99999`, `enter abc`, `leave` when not in an instance, `here` when already in one. | `enter 0` is a leave. "There is no instance 99999." Usage text. "You are not in an instance." "You are already in an instance. Leave it first." |
| B8 | P2 | A Developer-level and a Player account try `/instance`. | Not available. |

### C. Isolation

Use two characters at the same coordinates: one in an instance, one in the persistent world.

| ID | P | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | P0 | `ADMIN` in an instance, `A` outside, same spot. | Neither sees the other. `/who` still lists both. Global chat and tells work. |
| C2 | P0 | `/create` an item in the persistent world, enter an instance, look. Then the other way round. | Items are only seen from the instance they were made in. |
| C3 | P0 | A monster made in the instance next to `ADMIN`, with `A` outside. Then `/instance enter N A`. | It attacks only `ADMIN`. After `A` is sent in it can attack `A` too. |
| C4 | P1 | `A` casts a bolt, a ring spell and fires an arrow at the other's spot. | Nothing is hit, no effects are seen across. Both directions. |
| C5 | P1 | Both run through each other's spot. | No collision, no pushing. |
| C6 | P0 | Two instances of `test-holtburg`. Kill a monster and open a door in one. | The other instance's copy is untouched. Corpses and loot are not seen across. |
| C7 | P0 | Hard-coded activation targets: in a landblock from the table in appendix C, `/instance here 0`, use the button or lever. Have a second character stand by the same door in the persistent world. | The door in the **instance** reacts. The persistent world's door does not. No `couldn't find activation target` warning in the log. |
| C8 | P1 | A parent with a linked child (`landblock_instance_link`): a door, or a trap, with a lever or a pressure plate as its child. When the two are made, the child's `ActivationTarget` is set to its parent, so in an instance it has to be the instance's own copy. Appendix C has some to try: `/teleloc` to the child, `/instance here 0`, use the lever or step on the plate, and have a second character stand by the parent in the persistent world. | The parent **in the instance** reacts (the door opens, the trap goes off). The persistent world's parent does not. Then use the child in the persistent world: the instance's parent does not react. No `couldn't find activation target` line in the log. |
| C9 | P1 | A spawn camp (generator) in an instance. Kill its monsters. | They respawn in the instance. The persistent world's copy does not change. |
| C10 | P1 | Local chat, `/say`, emotes. | Not heard across instances. Tells, fellowship and allegiance chat work across. |
| C11 | P2 | A portal summoned inside an instance. | Seen and usable only there. Its destination is in the persistent world. |
| C12 | P2 | Chess in an instance. | The pieces appear in the instance. |
| C13 | P2 | A vendor and an NPC with a quest inside an instance. | Buying, selling and quest flags work. |
| C14 | P0 | **A monster's memory of who it fought: leaving.** `ADMIN` (attackable) opens an instance (`/instance here 0`), makes a monster in it with `/create` (weak is fine) and hits it. `D` is sent in (`/instance enter N D`) and hits it too. `ADMIN` leaves (`/instance leave`) and stands with `A` in the persistent world at the same spot, both within 15 m of the monster. Wait a minute, then have `D` strike it once, then twice, then ten times over. Then send `A` in, let the monster attack `A`, and send `A` out (`/instance leave A`) while it is attacking. | `ADMIN` and `A` never see the monster and are never attacked, however many times `D` strikes, and `A` takes no damage after being sent out. The monster keeps fighting `D`. The log has no `Fixed invisible attacker` line. |
| C15 | P0 | **The same, entering.** In the persistent world `ADMIN` (attackable) and `A` hit a monster. `ADMIN` opens an instance at the same spot (`/instance here 0`) and stays in it, while `A` strikes the monster once, then twice, then ten times over. | The monster never attacks `ADMIN` in the instance and `ADMIN` never sees it. It keeps fighting `A`. The log has no `Fixed invisible attacker` line. |

### D. Movement, portals and teleports

| ID | P | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | P0 | From inside an instance: lifestone recall, `/telepoi`, a portal spell, each to a place **outside** the instance's landblocks. | You arrive in the persistent world. `/instance info` says 0. No errors. (To a place inside them you stay in the instance: that is D2.) |
| D2 | P0 | `/tele` or `/teleloc` to coordinates inside the instance's landblocks, then outside them. | Inside: you stay in the instance. Outside: persistent world. |
| D3 | P0 | `/teleto A` with `A` in an instance, from the persistent world. `/teletome A`, `/movetome` on `A`, `/teleallto`. | You join `A`'s instance. `A` is brought into yours. `teleallto` brings everyone into the destination's instance. |
| D4 | P1 | With an instance-only island configured: `/tele` to it, and a portal weenie whose destination is in it. | "That place is no longer there." or "only exists as an instance". You stay where you were. |
| D5 | P1 | Portals inside a dungeon instance, and its exit portal. | Inside portals keep you in the instance. The exit goes to the persistent world. |
| D6 | P1 | 20 times quickly: `/instance enter N`, `/instance leave` (or the same on `A`). | No stuck "teleporting", no duplicate models, no client crash, no errors. You end up where expected. |
| D7 | P1 | Send `A` into an instance while `A` is casting a recall. | The end state is consistent: `/instance info A` has no `MISMATCH`. |
| D8 | P2 | `/telereturn` after `/teletome` brought a player into an instance. | The player goes back to the old coordinates. They stay in the instance only if that spot is inside its landblocks, otherwise they are in the persistent world: the instance the spot was in is not remembered. |

### E. Player lifecycle

| ID | P | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | P0 | Log out inside an instance, log in. | In the persistent world at the return position (the sanctuary if the template has none). The instance's player count went down. |
| E2 | P0 | Pull the network on a client inside an instance. | Treated as a logout when the server drops the session. `list` shows 0 players. |
| E3 | P0 | With a player in a normal (not instance-only) instance: (a) stop the server cleanly, start it, log in; (b) do it again but kill the process instead. | (a) The player is logged out first, so they are at the return position, as in E1. (b) The player is at their last saved coordinates in the persistent world, which is the same spot. In both, `/instance list` is empty: instances do not survive a restart. |
| E4 | P0 | Kill the server process with a player inside an **instance-only** island. Start, log in. (Or, with the server stopped, edit the character's `biota_properties_position` row, see appendix B.) | The player is moved to the return position or sanctuary. Log: `[INSTANCE] <name> was saved inside <template>, which only exists as an instance. Moving them to ...`. |
| E5 | P0 | Die in an instance twice: once with your lifestone bound outside the instance's landblocks, once bound to a lifestone that is inside them (bind it while you are in the instance). | No corpse. No items lost. Vitae applied. You respawn at the bound lifestone: in the persistent world the first time, in the instance the second time. |
| E6 | P0 | Die in the persistent world. | Corpse, drops and corpse run as before. |
| E7 | P0 | In an instance: drop a stack, split a stack onto the ground, drop an equipped item. Then move items between containers, give to an NPC, trade. | The drops are refused ("You can't drop items here."), nothing changes. The rest works. |
| E8 | P1 | Trade with a player in the same instance. Try to trade with someone outside. | Works inside. Impossible across (they cannot be seen). |
| E9 | P1 | Fellowship, `A` and `B` in the same instance. Kill a monster. | XP and kill credit are shared. |
| E10 | P0 | **Fellowship across instances.** `A` in the persistent world and `B` in an instance, same coordinates, same fellowship. `B` kills a monster. Check with `/fellow-info` and `/fellow-dist`. | `A` gets no shared XP and no kill-task credit. The distance scalar is 0 across instances and 1 inside one. Quest XP is still shared. |
| E11 | P0 | **Pets.** `A` summons a pet in the persistent world, then `/instance enter N A`. Also summon inside an instance, then leave. | The pet is destroyed, within seconds (its landblock has to tick, so a dormant one may take a little longer). `A` can summon another. No stranded pet in the old instance. |
| E12 | P0 | **Housing.** Inside an instance copy of a landblock that has a slumlord: try to buy and to rent. | "You can't do that here." No change to the character's house data (appendix B query 5). |
| E13 | P1 | Send `A` into an instance while `A` has a vendor or chest window open. | Nothing breaks: no errors, and the vendor or chest cannot be used from the instance. (Whether the window closes by itself is up to the existing teleport code.) |
| E14 | P1 | Allegiance: a vassal kills in an instance. | The patron's XP passup works (allegiance is global by design). |
| E15 | P2 | Quest kill counts and collect items in an instance. | Counted. |
| E16 | P2 | House recall from an instance. | Works. You are in the persistent world. |
| E17 | P0 | A lifestone inside an **instance-only** island: bind there, leave the island, then die, or cast the lifestone recall, in the persistent world. | Lifestone recall: the teleport is refused ("That place is no longer there."). Death: the unreachable lifestone is skipped, so the character revives at their `Instantiation` point (where they started) if that is reachable, otherwise at Holtburg (`WorldManager.DefaultFallbackPosition`) — never at the raw coordinates of the lifestone, and never where they died. See section 5. |

### F. Islands, rings and instance-only

Use `test-holtburg` (1 landblock plus ring) and `test-big` (3 x 3 plus ring) with `instanceOnly: false` first. For F7 to F9 use a landblock without housing and set `instanceOnly: true`.

| ID | P | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | P0 | `/instance open test-big`. | You arrive at the entry position. `list` shows "25 landblock(s), 16 of them ring". |
| F2 | P0 | Walk over the borders between the interior landblocks. | No gaps, no invisible walls, buildings and trees are seen across borders. |
| F3 | P0 | Walk into the ring from each side and each corner, five times. | "You can go no further that way." You are teleported to the last spot you stood on in the interior. No loops, no `MISMATCH`, no errors. |
| F4 | P1 | Run with buffs, jump over the border, get knocked into the ring by a strong monster or spell. | Turned back every time. Never in the void, never stuck outside. |
| F5 | P1 | Run out of the entry position into the ring before doing anything else. | You are sent back to the entry position. |
| F6 | P0 | At the outer edge of the outermost ring landblock. | Solid: players are put back, monsters, pets and projectiles stop. |
| F7 | P0 | **Instance-only.** Set `instanceOnly: true`, restart. From the persistent world: `/tele` to it, walk toward it from the next landblock, and keep pushing on. | `/tele` is refused. You are stopped at the border like at a wall (put back each time you push on), and `/myloc` `Location` stays in the persistent landblock. At most one `[INSTANCE] Something asked the persistent world for landblock ...` error for each landblock. Walking along its border does not make the loaded landblock count in `/serverstatus` grow. |
| F8 | P1 | Two instances of the same island, one player in each. | The ring works separately in each. Nothing is shared. |
| F9 | P1 | `/instance close` the island with a player in it. | The player goes to the `return` position, or the sanctuary if there is none. |
| F10 | P1 | An island with `bufferRing: 0`. | The edge is solid, nobody is turned back. Objects that would spawn within about a metre of the edge do not appear. |
| F11 | P2 | An island at the edge of the map (x or y 0 or 254). | The ring stops at the map edge. No errors. |
| F12 | P2 | A big island: the bundled `aerlinthe` (210 landblocks with the ring), or a 5 x 5 rectangle (49 with the ring) or larger. Record `/serverstatus` before and after opening it, how long the pause is, and again after `close`. | The numbers to compare: about 3 to 4 seconds and 64 MB for 210 landblocks (section 7). `close` gives the landblock count back, and the memory that is not cache. Opening the same island a second time is cheaper than the first. |
| F13 | P2 | Entry position with a `z` under the ground, and one where the cell does not match `x` and `y`. | Note what happens. These are mistakes in the file, not bugs, but it shows what an admin sees when the entry is wrong. |
| F14 | P0 | **Run past the edge, then teleport back.** In an instance run past the edge for 30 seconds, then `/telepoi` or `/tele` to the middle of the block, in the same instance. (This was the bug found by S4: see section 7.) | All the landblock's objects (NPCs, monsters, portals, lifestone) are still shown. `/instance info` has no `MISMATCH`. If a character is ever in this state, `/instance leave` then `/instance enter N` (or logging out and in) fixes it. |

### G. Fellowship dungeons (`capstone_instanced_dungeons`)

| ID | P | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | P0 | Property empty. Enter a capstone dungeon. | Exactly as before: numbered copies, `@capstone` shows them, no `capstone:` instance. |
| G2 | P0 | Set it to `Glenden Wood Dungeon`. Fellowship `A` (leader) + `B`; `A` enters, then `B` enters. | Both are in the same instance. `@capstone` shows "instance N, 2 player(s)". `/instance info` shows template `capstone:Glenden Wood Dungeon`. |
| G3 | P0 | A second fellowship enters. | A different instance. The two do not see or affect each other. |
| G4 | P0 | Landblock modifiers chosen by the leader (loot quality, lethality...). | They apply to monsters and loot in the instance, the same as in a copy. Compare with a copy of the same dungeon. |
| G5 | P0 | `A` and `B` go through the entrance at the same moment, 10 times (a new fellowship each time, or wait until the instance has been deleted). | One instance for the fellowship, never two: `/instance list` shows one `capstone:` instance. |
| G6 | P1 | Leave by the exit. Re-enter within the timeout. Then leave and wait past it. | Within it: the same instance, monsters killed stay dead. After it: deleted, and a new entry gives a fresh dungeon. |
| G7 | P1 | Disband or change the leader while inside. | Players stay. No errors. The instance is deleted after everyone has left and the timeout has passed. |
| G8 | P1 | Enter the dungeon without a fellowship. | Same as before. No errors. |
| G9 | P1 | Add `Lugian Mines` and `Mines of Despair` to the property. | Ignored: they still use their copies. |
| G10 | P1 | Die inside. | No corpse, nothing lost, sanctuary respawn. |
| G11 | P1 | Monster levels and health against `docs/fellowship-dungeon-scaling.md`, for the same fellowship size, instance against copy. | The same. |
| G12 | P1 | Stop the server with a fellowship inside, start, log in. | Sanctuary, as for the copies. |
| G13 | P2 | `@capstone <dungeon>` for an instanced dungeon. | It only looks at the copies, so it can say "No instances of ... are active" while an instance is. Known: use plain `@capstone`, `/instance list` and `/instance info`. |

### H. Admin tools

| ID | P | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | P0 | `/instance info` with nothing selected, with an object appraised, with `A`, with `0x<guid>` of an object in another instance, with nonsense. | You, and the selected object, are described (instance, place, no `MISMATCH`). A guid works from anywhere. Nonsense gives a clear message. |
| H2 | P0 | `/myloc`, `/getinfo` on an appraised object. | Show `Instance:`. |
| H3 | P0 | `/instance enter N A`, `leave A`, `enter 0 A`. | `A` is moved. The audit channel shows who sent whom. |
| H4 | P0 | `/instance move N` on an item and on a monster made in the persistent world (`/create`). Then `move 0` to bring them back. | They disappear from one instance and appear in the other, at the same spot. A monster fights only players in the instance it is in. An item can be picked up there. |
| H5 | P0 | Refusals of `/instance move`: a player, a door or statue (by guid), a monster from a spawn camp, a generator, an item in a bag, a closing instance, an instance that does not exist, a place outside the target's landblocks, `move 0` into an instance-only landblock. | Each is refused with its reason, and the object is exactly as it was. |
| H6 | P1 | `/create`, `/ci`, `/createnamed`, `/createliveops`, `/moveto` inside an instance. `/getinfo` on the result. | The object is in your instance. |
| H7 | P1 | `/nudge`, `/rotate` and the content commands on a static in an instance. | Refused. No new file in the `Content` folder, and no world-database change. |
| H8 | P2 | `@capstone`. | Lists open capstone instances. |

### I. Persistence and database

| ID | P | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| I1 | P0 | Record appendix B query 4. Run a whole instance session without picking anything up: create, `/create` 20 items and 10 monsters, kill some, let corpses drop loot, close. Wait two minutes. Record again. | Nothing new except what belongs to the characters (login time, position). Query 1 gives 0. |
| I2 | P0 | In an instance pick up an item made there, buy from a vendor, use consumables. Log out, log in. | The character's items are saved normally. |
| I3 | P0 | After H7 and F-tests. | World database unchanged (`landblock_instance` counts, `last_Modified`), and the `Content` folder has no new files. |
| I4 | P1 | An item made in the persistent world, saved to the shard, then `/instance move`d into an instance. Close the instance, restart. | The item does not reappear in the persistent world. If its row stays in `biota`, record it. |
| I5 | P0 | Appendix B queries 1, 2 and 3 after everything in this plan. | 0 rows. |
| I6 | P1 | Appendix B query 5 after E12. | No house rows changed. |

### J. Concurrency, capacity and soak

| ID | P | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| J1 | P0 | **Parallel ticking on** (both flags true). Run the smoke test and C1 to C6 with at least three players in two instances plus the persistent world. | No `cross-thread operation`, no `[INSTANCE] Cell ... was looked up in the persistent world by code running for instance`, no `[INSTANCE] ... was spawned into the persistent world`, no NullReference. |
| J2 | P1 | The same with both flags false. | The same. |
| J3 | P1 | 30 times: `/instance here 1`, enter, leave, then wait for the deletion (or `/instance close N` to skip the wait). | After all: `/serverstatus` landblocks are back near the baseline, and so is `GC.GetTotalMemory` in `/gcstatus` after `/forcegc` (not "MB used"). Instance ids keep counting up. No errors. |
| J4 | P1 | `/instance here 2` and `/instance close N` as soon as you arrive. Also right after `/instance open`. | No exception. |
| J5 | P1 | Three or four players `/instance enter N` at the same second. Two admins `/instance open test-holtburg` at the same second. | Everyone is in. One shared instance, not two. |
| J6 | P1 | Soak: two or three players in two instances playing normally for two hours. `/serverstatus` every 15 minutes. | Memory levels off (`GC.GetTotalMemory` in `/gcstatus` after `/forcegc`, not "MB used"). No error growth in the log. No lag. When everyone leaves and the timeouts pass, it comes back. |
| J7 | P2 | **Idle cost.** Run `/serverperformance start` before opening the island (`start cumulative` on its own does not start the monitor). Open a big island and stand in it. Take `/serverstatus` at about 90 s (`dormant` should be almost all of the island's landblocks), and again when `Total Server Objects` has stopped growing (6 to 7 minutes for 210 landblocks). Then take `/serverstatus` at the start and at the end of 5 minutes standing still, and run `/serverperformance` at the end of them. Then close the island and repeat the 5 minutes as the baseline, standing in the same place with the monitor still running (it costs CPU itself, so the two windows have to match). Then ten instances of `test-big` at once (250 landblocks). | Within a minute or two the landblocks nobody is near are dormant (verified, section 7, third run). Dormancy stops monster AI and physics, but not generators or the 5 second heartbeat, so a settled island costs somewhat more CPU per minute than the baseline, and `/serverperformance` shows where (the `~5m` column of `Landblock_Tick_GeneratorUpdate`, `Landblock_Tick_GeneratorRegeneration`, `Landblock_Tick_Monster_Tick`, `Landblock_Tick_Heartbeat` and the others). Instances are kept loaded until deleted, but idle landblocks go dormant like any others. |
| J8 | P2 | Create and close `test-big` 20 times. | No `Out of ephemeral static GUIDs` in the log. |
| J9 | P1 | **Dynamic guids.** Note `DynamicGuidAllocator` in `/serverstatus` before, after opening a big island, and after `close`: `sequence gap GUIDs available` (guids come from the gaps first), `current` (it only moves once the gaps are used up) and `recycled GUIDs available`. Repeat open and close 10 times. | An island uses dynamic guids for what it holds. Some come back when the instance is deleted (`recycled GUIDs available` rises), but in the runs so far (section 7) only about 3,000 of 27,000 did, and the likely cause is a discarded creature in `GeneratorProfile.Spawn`, not instancing. What has to hold is that each cycle uses about the same as the one before, and that the number not given back does not grow. A guid that is given back is held for 6 hours before it can be used again, so the gaps and `current` only run down; the space is about 2 billion, so this is a trend to watch, not a limit. |

### K. The persistent world must not have changed

The physics change is the biggest risk: a place with no landblock is now solid instead of passable.

| ID | P | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| K1 | P0 | With islands and `capstone_instanced_dungeons` empty: a full session of normal play (walk, combat, spells, loot, vendors, trade, fellowship XP, allegiance, chat, portals and recalls, house entry, storage chests). | Everything as before. |
| K2 | P0 | Teleport somewhere remote, then run across several landblock borders in a row, on foot, fast, and flying (admin). | No invisible walls at borders of landblocks that were not loaded yet. |
| K3 | P0 | Walk, swim and jump at the edge of the map (landblock x or y 0 or 254). | The same as before: you cannot leave the map, nothing gets lost. |
| K4 | P0 | Leave an area and wait for its landblocks to unload. Come back. | They unload and load as before. No errors. |
| K5 | P1 | Dungeons, building interiors, stairs, doors, cell seams. | No sticking. |
| K6 | P1 | Monsters, pets and projectiles crossing landblock borders. | Normal. |
| K7 | P1 | `/serverstatus`, `/serverperformance`, `/landblockstats` under the same load as a baseline build (`main`). | No measurable regression (within noise). |
| K8 | P1 | Buy, abandon and pay rent for a house in the persistent world. Guest lists. | As before (the new guard only applies inside instances). |
| K9 | P2 | `/tele`, `/teleto`, `/teletome`, `/movetome`, `/create`, `/ci` with nobody in an instance. | As before. |
| K10 | P2 | Startup time and memory with the feature unused. | The same as the baseline. |

### L. Systems that look at positions

| ID | P | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | P1 | **Portal storms / resonance zones** (`ResonanceZoneService`). It groups every online player by landblock number and checks coordinates, without the instance. Stand in an instance of a landblock that has an active storm zone. | Record whether the storm hits you. **A decision is needed** (section 5). |
| L2 | P1 | Look for other systems that scan players or objects by position: search the server code for `GetAllOnline()`, `Location.Landblock` and `DistanceTo(`. For each, run the test "two players at the same coordinates in different instances" and see if one affects the other. | Nothing crosses. Anything that does goes on the list in section 5. |
| L3 | P2 | Events (`EventManager`) that turn generators on and off. | Instance copies follow the event like the persistent landblock. Note it. |
| L4 | P1 | **Houses in an instance.** Make an instance of a landblock that has houses, some owned and some not. Walk into the yard and through the door of each, as a player and as an admin. From reading the code, not from running it: the restricted cells of a house (its yard and its doors) find their house by its world guid through `ServerObjectManager.GetObjectA`, which ignores the instance, so in an instance they use the persistent house's owner, or are closed to everyone when that landblock is not loaded. | Record what happens. **A decision is needed** (section 5). An unowned house is open in the persistent world, so open to everyone is the natural reading for a copy. |

### M. Failures

| ID | P | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | P1 | `/forcelogoff` a player standing in an island. | No exception. The player is removed. Instance membership is cleaned up. |
| M2 | P1 | Two admins `close` and `enter` the same instance at the same time. | No exception. Consistent afterwards. |
| M3 | P2 | `close` while a player is dead or in portal space. | They arrive in the persistent world. Not stuck. |
| M4 | P2 | Count `[INSTANCE]` lines in a ten minute idle session. | A handful, not one per tick. |

### N. Training academies (an instance for each player)

New characters start in `20FC` (Shoushi), `20FD` (Yaraq) or `20FE` (Holtburg), and log in there inside an instance of their own (`academy:shoushi`, `academy:yaraq`, `academy:holtburg`). Use ordinary player accounts, so that nothing is different from what a new player gets. (An admin character who logs in inside an academy is put in an instance too. An admin who wants the persistent academy uses `/instance leave`, then `/tele`.)

| ID | P | Steps | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| N1 | P0 | Create a new character for each of the three starter towns and log in. `/instance info`, `/myloc`, `/instance list`. | The character is in an instance of `academy:<town>`, inside it, at the start (cell `0x20FC016E`, `0x20FD016E`, `0x20FE016E`, x 29.9, y -130). `list` shows the template as "1 landblock(s), one for each player" and "1 player(s) in it". The log has `[INSTANCE] Created instance N: academy:<town> (1 landblock)` and no error. The start position and everything in the academy is as before (the dungeon is there, nothing is missing). |
| N2 | P0 | Two new characters at once, from two accounts, in the same starter town. Both use the Life Stone, open the chests, fight the sparring golems. | Each has an instance of their own (`list` shows two). They never see each other. What one does (a chest opened, a golem killed, a door opened by the Life Stone) does not show in the other's academy. |
| N3 | P0 | Do the whole academy in the instance: the Life Stone (the door opens), the class chest and its key, the sparring golems, the training targets, the quests, and the exit portals (try both). | Everything works as it did with the shared academy: quests are stamped, items are given, the portal sets the sanctuary to the town outpost and takes the character there. `/instance info` in town says 0 (the persistent world). |
| N4 | P0 | In the academy, walk somewhere other than the start, log out, log in. | In a **new** instance of the same academy (a new id), at the same place (`/myloc`), not in the persistent world. The old instance has 0 players and is deleted after the timeout. The character still has the quests and items they had. |
| N5 | P0 | Kill the server process while a character is in the academy. Start, log in. | The same as N4: a new instance, the last saved position. |
| N6 | P1 | Die in the academy (a sparring golem, or `/die`), once with the start as the bound lifestone and once after using the Life Stone. | No corpse, nothing lost, vitae applied. Respawn at the bound lifestone **in the same instance**. |
| N7 | P1 | After leaving the academy by a portal, die in town before binding to any other lifestone. | The sanctuary is the town outpost that the portal set, so the character respawns there, in the persistent world. |
| N8 | P1 | `/modifybool starter_academy_instances false`. Create a new character and log in. Then set it back to true and log in with another. | With it off the character is in the persistent academy (`/instance info` says 0), as before, and nobody who is in an academy instance is moved. With it on, the next login is in an instance. |
| N9 | P1 | A character that was saved inside an academy before this change (or a second character logged out there with the property off) logs in with it on. | In a new instance at the saved place. |
| N10 | P1 | Admin: `/instance open academy:holtburg`, then `/instance list`, `/instance leave`, `/instance close <id>` with a player inside. | One shared instance (like any template). `leave` sends the admin to the outpost that the first Holtburg exit portal leads to. `close` sends the player there too. |
| N11 | P1 | Leave the academy by a portal and wait past `instance_empty_timeout_minutes`. `/instance list`. | The academy instance is gone (`[INSTANCE] Deleted instance N`), and `/serverstatus` landblocks are back to the baseline. |
| N12 | P1 | Fellowship, chat and trade between two new characters in different academy instances. | They can't see each other and get no shared kill XP (as for any two instances), and they can meet, group and trade once both are in the town. |
| N13 | P2 | Make 20 characters and log them all in within a minute (or log one in and out 20 times). | 20 instances, all deleted after the timeout, no error, and the login time per character (the academy's landblock is loaded as the character enters) is short enough not to be noticed. `/serverstatus` memory levels off after the timeout. |
| N14 | P2 | Make the instance fail on purpose, in a scratch build (for example, make `InstanceManager.Load` throw for `academy:holtburg`), and log in. | `[INSTANCE] Could not make an instance of academy:holtburg for <name>` with the exception, and the character enters the persistent academy instead. They are not stuck, and `list` has no leftover instance once the next tick has run. |

## 5. Decisions needed

1. **Portal storm zones in instances (L1).** Today a storm hits players in every instance of that landblock. Should instances be exempt, or is a storm an event of the world that reaches everyone?
2. **Fellowship XP across instances (E10).** Fixed so that members in different instances do not share kill XP or credit. Quest XP is unchanged. Confirm this is what you want.
3. **Death in an instance (E5).** *Decided 2026-09-20.* No corpse, no loss of items, and vitae still applies (S6 passed as designed). The player respawns at their bound lifestone by the normal teleport rule, so in the instance if that lifestone is inside it. The alternative, always leaving the instance on death, cannot work for an instance-only island, where the persistent world has nothing at those coordinates. *E17 edge revised 2026-09-23.* Live testing found the E17 edge was not "revived where they died" as first assumed: it was two unvalidated fallbacks (`ThreadSafeTeleportOnDeath`'s `Sanctuary ?? Instantiation ?? Location`, and a `NullReferenceException` risk in the lifestone-death-broadcast landblock lookup) that between them could land a player at the raw, empty coordinates of an unreachable lifestone. Worse, "revives where they died" was rejected outright as a design: bind to a lifestone you can then make unreachable, and every death after that is free. Fixed: the respawn chain now checks each candidate with `InstanceManager.CanReach` (the same check `Teleport()` itself makes) and falls back to a fixed safe spot (`WorldManager.DefaultFallbackPosition`, Holtburg) if none are reachable — never the death location. Lifestone binding inside instance-only islands is still allowed (E5/S6's bind-and-revive-while-inside case is unaffected); only the leave-then-die/recall edge changed.
4. **Anything L2 finds.**
5. **Houses in instances (L4).** The yard and the doors of a house look their house up by its world guid, without the instance. Decide what a house in an instance is: open to everyone, as an unowned house is (my suggestion, since a copy has no owner and nothing in it persists), or governed by the owner of the persistent house.
6. **Training academies (N).** Made with these choices, each easy to change: (a) the academies in the persistent world stay (`instanceOnly: false` in `StarterAcademies`), so builders and admins can still go there; the alternative is to make them instance only, which removes the persistent copies and moves anyone saved there; (b) a player who logs out in an academy is saved where they are and gets a new instance there on the next login, and does not restart the academy or get sent to the town; (c) an emptied academy instance lives `instance_empty_timeout_minutes` (15) although nobody can ever enter it again, and a shorter timeout for personal templates would free it sooner (not built); (d) new characters can't group, trade or talk to each other in the academy, only in the town; (e) the feature is on by default, with `starter_academy_instances` as the switch. Confirm.

## 6. Exit criteria

- Every P0 passes, on both threading settings (J1 and J2).
- No unexpected `[INSTANCE]` error, exception or `cross-thread` line in the logs, and no ephemeral ids in the database (appendix B).
- K1 to K4 pass, and K7 shows no regression.
- Every P1 failure is fixed or accepted in writing.

## 7. Findings from running the plan

| Date | Test | Result | What it showed | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-20 | S1, S2, S3 | Pass | | |
| 2026-09-20 | S4 | **Fail** | A player ran nine landblocks past the edge of a `/instance here 1`. `/myloc` had `Location` in landblock DD4D while `Physics` was still at the west edge of E64E and `CurrentLandblock` was E64E. The log had ten `[INSTANCE] ... moved to ..., which is not part of instance 1` warnings and no exception. A `/telepoi hebian-to` back to E74E, in the same instance, then showed none of the landblock's objects. | Cause: the client moves itself and reports positions; the server stopped its physics object at the edge but accepted the reported position, so the client left and dropped the objects while the server still counted them as known, and did not send them again on the teleport back. Fixed in `Player_Tick.cs` (the position is refused and the client put back), and `/instance info` now reports a position outside the instance as a `MISMATCH`. Retested below. |
| 2026-09-20 | S4, F14 | Pass | Run again after the fix: the client is put back at the edge, and the landblock's objects are still there after teleporting back. The server log since the restart has no `moved to ..., which is not part of instance` warning. | Fixed and verified. |
| 2026-09-20 | S5 | Pass | Run earlier in the day, before the current tip. | |
| 2026-09-20 | S6 | Pass | `A` bound a lifestone inside instance 1, died there, and respawned at that lifestone in instance 1 (the normal teleport rule). No corpse, items kept, vitae applied. | Respawn rule decided: keep (section 5, decision 3). |
| 2026-09-20 | S7 | Pass | | |
| 2026-09-20 | S8 | Pass | | |
| 2026-09-20 | S9 | Pass | Run earlier in the day, before the current tip. | |
| 2026-09-20 | S10 | Pass | `A` logged out inside `here-A9B4` and logged in again. The log has no `[INSTANCE]` warning, no exception and no `cross-thread` line. The only errors are the `UpsertAccountWealthSnapshot` ones that every login and logout gets, which have nothing to do with instancing. There is also one `TrySplit` warning (3.65 ms) as the instance was unloaded: ACE logs that whenever splitting a landblock group takes more than 3 ms, and it is not a fault. | |
| 2026-09-20 | S11 | Pass | Appendix B query 1 on `ace_shard` returned `COUNT(*)` 0. | |
| 2026-09-20 | S12 | Pass | | |
| 2026-09-20 | A1 | Pass | With the shipped file the server logged one `Island` line for each of the three, and no error: `aerlinthe` 210 landblocks (54 of them ring), `test-holtburg` 9 (8 of them ring), `test-big` 25 (16 of them ring). | |
| 2026-09-20 | A2 | Pass | With no `instances.json` next to the server the log has `There is no ...instances.json, so there are no islands`, and the server starts normally. | |
| 2026-09-20 | A3 | Pass | `/instance list` shows the three templates: `aerlinthe` 210 landblock(s), 54 of them ring; `test-big` 25, 16 of them ring; `test-holtburg` 9, 8 of them ring. "Instance templates (3)", "Open instances (0)". | |
| 2026-09-20 | A5 | Partly done, and a bug | The first four items are accepted, as expected: comments, trailing commas, `"Name"` in capitals (on `aerlinthe`) and `"return": {}` (on `test-holtburg`). The server started with all three islands and no error. The text `"instanceOnly": "true"` was refused, but with a .NET message about System.Nullable of Boolean (Path: $.islands[2].instanceOnly), and **no island loaded at all**, not only that one. The `return` with something in it but no cell has not been run yet. | The parser read the whole file in one call, so one value of the wrong kind anywhere threw and lost every island, which the docs say does not happen. Fixed in `InstanceTemplateConfig.cs`: each island is read on its own, and the message says what was wrong, for instance `island 'x': instanceOnly has to be true or false, without quotes`. Needs a rebuild, then `instanceOnly` in quotes again. |
| 2026-09-20 | A4 | Pass | Each mistake that was tried logged its own error and left only that island out, and the good islands still loaded. Seen in the log with the expected text: no name, a name used twice, a name starting `capstone:`, `instanceOnly` missing, landblock `"E7"`, no landblocks, an entry outside the island's landblocks, no entry, a cell of 7 digits, `qw` 0, more than 400 landblocks (`it is 420 landblocks with its ring`), `bufferRing` out of range, and text that is not JSON. Not in the log: `return` inside the island, and `return` in an instance-only island. | |
| 2026-09-20 | A5 | Pass | All six items. Accepted, with all three islands loaded: the first four (the run that has `"Name"` in capitals and `"return": {}` loaded `aerlinthe`, `test-holtburg` and `test-big`). Refused with their own error while the other islands still loaded: `"return": { "x": 1 }` (`return: it has no cell...`) and, after the rebuild with the fix above, `"instanceOnly": "true"` (`island 'test-big': instanceOnly has to be true or false, without quotes`, with `aerlinthe` loading). | |
| 2026-09-20 | A6 | Pass | Reported as passing. There is no `Something asked the persistent world for landblock` line in the logs, so it was probably skipped, which the case allows ("if you use one"). | |
| 2026-09-20 | F12, J7 (first numbers) | Data, and a bug | Opening a 210 landblock island (`aerlinthe`) with one player: 3 to 4 s pause; memory 1,206 to 1,270 MB; landblocks 10 to 220 active, 0 dormant; objects 205 to 1,903; landblock groups 2 to 3; Cell.dat files cached 224 to 702; world database landblock content cached 10 to 211; shard biotas unchanged (~733); dynamic guids: `sequence gap` 88,116 to 83,667 and `recycled` 25 to 196. The 0 dormant was the bug: an instance keeps its landblocks loaded with `Permaload`, and a `Permaload` landblock skips the dormancy check, so all 210 would stay fully active (monster AI and physics) for as long as the instance lived. The `creatures` count did not change (52) because the snapshot was taken while the island was still filling in. | Dormancy fixed in `Landblock.cs` (an instance's landblocks go dormant when nobody is near, and are still never unloaded). Needs J7 run again after a rebuild. J9 added for the dynamic guids. |
| 2026-09-20 | J7, J9, F12 (second run, build without the dormancy fix) | Data, and a correction | The same island opened again (instance 2), six `/serverstatus` readings: at once, at 52 s, at 4 min 51 s, just after `/instance leave`, just after it was deleted (19:10:41Z, about a minute after leaving), and 5 minutes after that. **Dormant**: 0 of the 210 island landblocks at every reading. The 9 dormant at 52 s were persistent landblocks near where the player had been, and they were unloaded by the third reading (220 active became 211). **Deleting**: landblocks 212 to 2, objects 3,108 to 267 (the same 267 as the baseline 5 minutes later), landblock groups 3 to 2, memory 1,173 to 1,190 MB and 1,195 MB later (1,206 MB before the first open), so no leak. **Caches**: from the first reading to the last, `Cell.dat` files cached stayed at 866, `Portal.dat` went 1,085 to 1,090 and weenies 615 to 626. **CPU** (`Total CPU Time` over `Server Runtime`, in CPU seconds per minute): 10.4 for the first 52 s, 15.6 from 52 s to 4 min 51 s, 13.1 while leaving, 11.8 until it was deleted, and 7.6 for the baseline afterwards (standing in a dungeon, with 79 creatures loaded). **The first 5 minutes are not idle time.** Total objects went 1,966 to 3,003 and the dynamic guid `current` went `0x800369E0` to `0x8003AEF7` (17,687 guids) while `recycled` went 4,799 to 4,944, so the island was still creating things for the whole window, and dormancy does not touch that. From the first reading to the one after deletion 20,798 guids were allocated and 2,756 given back (2,602 of them in the minute that held the deletion). The 18,000 or so that were not given back are not explained. Just before it was deleted the island held about 2,840 objects, about one of them a creature (`Creatures` was 53 at the first three readings while 9 persistent landblocks unloaded, so those 53 are most likely in the one persistent landblock that stays loaded). | Correction to what J7 expected: dormancy stops monster AI and physics (`TickPhysics` returns, `Monster_Tick` is skipped) and nothing more. Generators and the heartbeat keep running in a dormant landblock. Re-run J7 after the rebuild by the new procedure (wait until the island has settled; use `/serverperformance start cumulative`; take the first reading at about 90 s, not 60). J9 (10 cycles) shows whether the guids not given back are the same each time. |
| 2026-09-20 | Setup (`instances.json`) | Bug | After a rebuild the island list was empty: `/instance open aerlinthe` said there was no template, and the startup log had `Loading instance templates (instances.json)...` with no island line after it (the 16:58:17Z start had `Island "aerlinthe": 210 landblocks`). The copy next to the server had been edited by hand before that start, and the source in `apps/server` was edited afterwards (13:00:19), so the source was the newer one, and the build copies a newer source over the output (`PreserveNewest`, as it does for `starterGear.json`). The plan had said to edit either copy, which that setting does not allow. Reproduced in a scratch output folder: build, edit the copy, make it older than the source, build again, and the edit is gone. | Fixed in `ACE.Server.csproj`: the build puts `instances.json` next to the server only when there is none, and never over one that is there. The same scenario after the fix: the edit survives, and deleting the copy and building brings the default back. The tests project links the shipped file, so the test that checks it still runs (the whole suite is 114 of 120, the same 6 environment failures as before). Setup row and `docs/instanced-landblocks.md` corrected. |
| 2026-09-20 | J7 (third run, with the dormancy fix) | Pass, with data | The island opened again (instance 1, after a restart), with seven `/serverstatus` readings: at the moment it opened, at 98 s, at 134 s, at 7 min 14 s, just after `/instance leave`, after it was deleted, and 5 minutes after that. **Dormancy works**: at 98 s there were 10 landblocks active and 202 dormant, which is 201 of the island's 210 plus the dungeon the player had left. The 10 active are the 9 next to the player and the one persistent landblock that is kept loaded. The island stays one landblock group (3 groups: the island, the dungeon and the kept landblock). **Teardown**: landblocks 212 to 2, objects 266 and then 267 (the baseline), memory 1,237 MB (1,236 MB when it opened). **CPU** (CPU seconds per minute): 13.5 for 0 to 98 s, 16.7 for 98 to 134 s, 13.6 for 134 s to 7 min 14 s, 11.1 for the 27 s before leaving, 13.7 for leaving and the deletion, 9.9 for the baseline. The window that matches the run before the fix (2 to 7 minutes in) is 13.6 against 15.6. The baselines cannot be compared: the monitor was off for the four island readings (`/serverperformance start cumulative` on its own does not start it, and the plan said to use it) and on for the baseline, and it costs CPU itself. Against the earlier baseline (7.6, no monitor) the island cost about 6 above it, against 8 before the fix. Against this run's baseline (9.9) it cost about 4. | Dormancy is verified live. The island costs about a tenth of a core or less, and what is left is not monster AI: the island had no creatures (next row). J7's command and its settling rule are corrected. |
| 2026-09-20 | J9 (third run) | Data, and a likely bug outside instancing | **The island has no creatures.** `Creatures` was 53 with the dungeon unloaded and 78 to 80 with it loaded, so the island held about 0 after 7 minutes, with about 2,900 other objects (about 2,650 of them dynamic: that is how many guids were given back when it was deleted). **Guids**: 26,687 used from the first reading to the last, 2,934 given back. `sequence gap GUIDs available` is the counter that moves while gaps are left; `current` moved in the runs before, when they had been used up. They are used in amounts that fit bursts of about 3,000 roughly once a minute: 4,078 in 98 s, 3,643 in 36 s, 15,671 in 300 s, 57 in 27 s, 3,072 in 57 s, and 166 in 5 minutes for the persistent baseline. The runs before show the same. While that went on the weenies cached rose 486 to 520 and the spells 32 to 41, with no creature to show for it. **Likely cause, from the code and not yet confirmed by a run**: in `GeneratorProfile.Spawn` (`GeneratorProfile.cs:359`) a generator makes the creature and, if it is attackable and does not use the archetype system, returns `null` without destroying it. Its guid, and those of what it carries, are never given back. No failure is recorded, so the generator tries again at its next regeneration. A 210 landblock island holds about 2,650 dynamic objects, mostly generators (`increase_minimum_encounter_spawn_density` is on by default, with 8 encounters for each outdoor landblock). It is not specific to instances: any loaded landblock with such generators does the same. | Proposed, not made: `wo.Destroy(false)` before that `return null`. If the cause is right, `recycled GUIDs available` then rises in step with the guids used. Whether the retries should also stop is a separate question. |
| 2026-09-20 | B4 at scale (from the log) | Pass | A 210 landblock instance was open for an hour with no warning or error in the log, and was deleted cleanly once it had been empty for its timeout (`[INSTANCE] Deleted instance 1: aerlinthe (210 landblocks)`). | |
| 2026-09-21 | B1, B2, B3 | Pass | The log has instance 1 (`here-A9B4`, 1 landblock) created at 06:36:17 and deleted at 06:37:59, and instances 2 and 3 (49 landblocks each, `here 3` and `here 9`) created at 06:37:49 and 06:38:19, with no `[INSTANCE]` error or warning and no exception. Not in the log: how long the 49 landblocks took to load (an instance's landblocks do not log a line each, so B3's "note how long it took" has no number) and the `/serverstatus` landblock count. | |
| 2026-09-21 | B5, B6, B7, B8 | Pass | Reported as passing. The log adds: instance 12 (49 landblocks) was deleted at 06:54:04, and instances 14 and 15 are both `test-holtburg` (9 landblocks), created 57 s apart (07:00:20 and 07:01:17), which fits `open test-holtburg` and `open test-holtburg new` (B6); 15 was deleted at 07:03:02. The log does not say whether instance 12 ended by `close` or by its timeout. B7 and B8 answer the player and leave nothing in the log. | |
| 2026-09-21 | Teardown warning (seen in B5) | Data | At 06:54:04.252, 32 ms after `Deleted instance 12`, the log has `[INSTANCE] "A passerby" (0x80002BED) can't enter instance 12 at A9B40019 [83.86 12.72 94.05], which is not part of it`, and the debug line under it says the generator `HometownWatchdogGen` inside the instance failed to spawn that creature. Appendix A listed this message as always a bug. Here it is a race at teardown: `InstanceManager.Tick` takes the instance out of its table, and only a tick later are its landblocks unloaded, so for that tick `LandblockManager.AddObject` finds no such instance and warns. The spawn is refused and `GeneratorProfile.Spawn` destroys the object and gives its guid back (`obj.Destroy()`), so nothing leaks. | Harmless but noisy. Decided 2026-09-21: keep it for now, no code change (the idea, if it is ever wanted: `AddObject` returns false without a warning when the instance is closing or gone). Appendix A says when the line is expected. |
| 2026-09-21 | B4 | Data, no leak found so far | Ten instances (1, 49, 49, 49, 49, 9, 25, 49, 49, 49 landblocks) were created and deleted, each between 68 s and 2 min 18 s after it was created, with no error, and more since; that fits `instance_empty_timeout_minutes` 1 counted from when the last player left (the log does not record the leave). The user saw `/serverstatus` "MB used" not fall after they closed, and the log has no memory numbers. What was found: (1) "MB used" is `Process.PrivateMemorySize64` (`ServerStatus.cs`), and the server runs Server GC, concurrent, `RetainVM` (`ACE.Server.csproj`), so freed heap stays committed. A sampler on the live process read 1,471 MB with nothing open, and 1,095 MB about two minutes later, when a build on the same machine (15.8 GB, 98% used) took the free RAM: about 380 MB was given back, which leaked objects could not be. The drop began with no instance open (two small 9 landblock instances were opened while it went on). (2) An offline check (real DATs, no database, 12 open and delete cycles of a 49 landblock instance with 15 objects in each landblock, also under the server's GC settings; `MemCheck`, not in the repository): with the server's per-tick step (`ProcessPendingLandblockGroupAdditions`) run, nothing of a deleted instance stayed alive after a full GC from the fourth cycle on, and the managed heap stayed at 125 to 126 MB (down 6 MB over 10 cycles). Without that step, as PhysRepro runs, 98 of 148 tracked objects stayed alive and the heap grew 30 MB a cycle: a heap dump of the test process showed the static `landblockGroupPendingAdditions` list holding every landblock (the world tick empties it). For the first cycles a queued background load held one landblock, and each landblock's adjacency list makes every other landblock of its instance reachable through it. (3) Limits: the offline check has no database, so the objects made from the world database (creatures, generators, vendors) are not in it. | Open until `/forcegc` then `/gcstatus` (`GC.GetTotalMemory`) is compared across repeated cycles on the live server. B4, J3 and J6 now ask for that number and not "MB used" (Setup). |
| 2026-09-21 | B4 (live check) | Data, no leak found | The user ran one round of 5 instances (`here-20FD`, 35 landblocks each, created 07:26:22 to 07:26:35 and deleted 07:27:25 to 07:27:36) and read `GC.GetTotalMemory` in `/gcstatus`: start 804 MB; all five open 928 MB (+124 MB, about 25 MB for each instance); all five closed 886 MB; a second check 904 MB; a minute later 835 MB; after `/forcegc` 797 MB, 7 MB under the start. Had the instances been kept, the heap after a full GC would be about 930 MB. The sampler on the same process read `/serverstatus` "MB used" at 1,150 MB before, 1,285 MB with the instances open, a peak of 1,372 MB as they were deleted, and 1,300 MB from 07:28:47 until 07:35:26; then it fell by itself (no instance had been opened since 07:27) to 1,160 MB at 07:37:35 and 1,173 MB after, within 23 MB of where it started, about ten minutes after the instances were gone. So "MB used" does come back, on the GC's schedule. Caveat: the start reading was not taken after a forced GC, and unforced readings move by 40 to 100 MB (904 to 835 in a minute), so a leftover of up to that size is not ruled out by this round alone. | Leaning pass. A second round that starts and ends with `/forcegc` then `/gcstatus` would remove the caveat. |
| 2026-09-21 | B4 | Pass | Called by the user after the live check and the offline check above. What is accepted with it: the start reading of the live check was not taken after a forced GC, so a leftover of up to about 100 MB is not strictly ruled out by that one round, and no second round from a forced start was run. | |
| 2026-09-21 | C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C9, C10, C11, C12, C13 | Pass | Reported as passing by the user. C8 has not been tested yet. What the log adds: between the B tests and now it has 12 instances (16 to 27), five of them the memory round of B4 (19 to 23); the other seven fit section C, and 11 of the 12 have ended, with no `[INSTANCE]` warning or error in the log. It fits C6 that two `test-holtburg` instances (17 and 18) were open together for 5 min 45 s (07:19:43 to 07:25:28). It fits C7 that instance 24 (`here-6545`, 1 landblock, 08:05:35 to 08:07:58) is in landblock 6545, which has 10 of the 38 activator pairs in appendix C (the most of any), and that there is no `couldn't find activation target` line in the log since 07:04. None of the lines that appendix A calls always a bug appears in that time (`looked up in the persistent world`, `spawned into the persistent world`, `wrong instance`, `not part of`, `cross-thread`, `NullReference`, `Out of ephemeral`, `REPORT THIS`), and there is no error line except the known noise: 321 debug lines of `ConnectionReset` from the connection listener when a client drops. What the log cannot show: which instance was used for which case, and what anyone saw (who sees whom, the door reacting, whom the monster attacks, respawns, chat, the portal, chess, the vendor and the quest), so those passes rest on the report. | |
| 2026-09-21 | Slow physics in 6545 (seen around C7) | Data | 13 `[PERFORMANCE][PHYSICS]` warnings of 327 to 792 ms in `UpdateObjectPhysics()`, all for "Sacrificial Edge" objects in landblock 6545, between 08:05:24 and 08:07:33. None of the 29 earlier logs (back to 2025-12-23) has one, and the first came 11 s before instance 24 existed, so the instance did not start it; but the line does not say which copy an object belongs to, so a doubling of the load by the copy is not ruled out. | Not investigated. Worth asking whether the game lagged there. If it did, compare 6545 with and without an instance (K7). |
| 2026-09-21 | D1, D2, D3, D6, D7, D8 | Pass | Reported as passing by the user. D4 and D5 have no result yet. What the log adds: from 08:19 to 11:18 it has 27 instances (27 to 53), all `here-A9B4` with 1 landblock except the last (9 landblocks), 26 of them ended and none logged an `[INSTANCE]` warning or error. It fits D6 that 21 instances (32 to 52) were made between 08:45:17 and 08:45:58, about one every 2 s, and that 32 to 51 were each deleted a minute later (08:46:18 to 08:46:55) with none stuck; but each cycle made a new instance, and entering and leaving an existing one leaves no line in the log, so a run of `enter N` and `leave` would not show. None of the lines that appendix A calls always a bug appears (`MISMATCH`, `not part of`, `cross-thread`, `NullReference`, `looked up in the persistent world`, `spawned into the persistent world`, `wrong instance`, `Out of ephemeral`, `REPORT THIS`, `couldn't find activation target`), and there is no teleport refusal (`That place is no longer there`, `only exists as an instance`), which fits D4 not having been run. Two lines are not instancing: `Database does not contain weenie 1010064 for instance 0x7018A258` (a static in landblock 018A whose weenie is in neither the world database nor the 9-19 dump; twice today, first at 08:36:05, and the same line is in 10 older logs back to 2025-12-23), and an `AuditItemSpells()` error at 11:08:36 (removing the spell Shrouded from a non-equipped item; the same audit is in the log of 2026-03-31). What the log cannot show: the teleports themselves (where anyone arrived, what `/instance info` said, whose instance they joined, the recalls and portals), so those passes rest on the report. | |
| 2026-09-21 | C8 | Pass | Reported as passing by the user. What the log adds: instance 54 (`here-2581`, 1 landblock) was made at 11:19:03, so C8 was done in landblock 2581, the one whose door has both a lever from a link and one from `ActivationTarget` (appendix C), and since 11:10 there is no `couldn't find activation target` line and none of the other always-a-bug lines. Not caused by the instance: landblock 2581 logged 21 `couldn't spawn` lines at 11:18:30, when its persistent copy loaded, and the same 21 at 11:19:03 for the instance's copy, now with ephemeral guids (`7FF...`): chests, doors, five vendors and generators in interior cells (0x2581013A to 0x25810170). The same objects fail in both worlds, so the failure does not depend on the instance, and statics that cannot be spawned into an interior cell are in older logs for other landblocks (0138 on 2026-03-25 to 27, DA75 on 2025-12-26 and 2026-05-18). Landblock 2581 is not on the list of landblocks whose interior cells are missing from the server dat (`server-dat-broken-landblocks.txt`), but a probe of the server dat found the reason (see the row on interior statics): it lists 5 interior cells for 2581 and the world database puts statics into 14 others, none of which exists, so those vendors, doors and chests cannot spawn in the persistent world either. (Older logs only have client `DDD transfer timeout` lines for its cells 0x25810100 to 0x25810104, on 2025-12-27.) What the log cannot show: which lever was used, and what the door did. | Not a C8 problem, and not this branch: the server dat lacks the cells (see the row on interior statics). |
| 2026-09-21 | D4 | Pass | Reported as passing by the user: the portal (wcid 7413, the Aerlinthe Island Portal, made with `/create` at 12:08:47) said "That place is no longer there.", and `/tele` said "Landblock 0xBAE9 only exists as an instance, and can't be teleported to". What the log adds: the server was restarted at 12:07:06 with `aerlinthe` as an instance-only island (`[INSTANCE] Island "aerlinthe": 210 landblocks, 54 of them ring, instance only`; the runtime `instances.json` has `"instanceOnly": true` for it). The one expected tripwire line came once for each refusal: at 12:08:49 for landblock BAE8, from `Portal.ActOnUse` through `AdjustDungeon` (the portal's destination is BAE8001D), and at 12:11:16 for BAE9, from `Tele.HandleTele` through `AdjustMapCoords`. Each is an Error with a stack trace, says the request was refused, and is what appendix A lists for D4; it comes from the step that works out the height of the destination, which asks for the landblock before the refusal stops the teleport. No other always-a-bug line since 11:26. Also, at 12:08:15, on the login after that restart, the log has E4's expected line: `"+Sorc" was saved inside "aerlinthe", which only exists as an instance. Moving them to 0x018A0289 ...`; E4 has not been reported, so it is not recorded. What the log cannot show: the refusal messages themselves, and that you stayed where you were. | |
| 2026-09-21 | D5 | Pass | Reported as passing by the user, in the Holtburg Redoubt dungeon (landblock 0163): they made it an instance, added the entry portal inside it and used it (they stayed in the instance), then used the surface portal and left the instance. What the log adds: instance 2 (`here-0163`, 9 landblocks; instance ids start again at 1 after the restart at 12:16:33) was made at 12:32:51 and deleted at 12:34:26, and there is no warning or error of any kind between those two times. The audit line at 12:33:07 says `+Sorc has created Holtburg Redoubt (0x800018F8) at 0x016301AC ...` (`/create`, so the entry portal was made in the world, inside the dungeon), and the only other line that names a position in 0163 during the run is a `[PERFORMANCE][PHYSICS]` line at 12:33:17 (`UpdatePlayerPosition`, 39.9 ms) at 016301A8, also an interior cell. After the restart at 12:16:33, up to 13:00, the log has no `[INSTANCE]` warning or error and none of the other always-a-bug lines (appendix A), and there is no `couldn't spawn` line for 0163 anywhere in it, so its statics spawned. This was a real dungeon test: the server dat lists 178 interior cells for 0163 and has all 35 that the world database puts statics into, so the dungeon-position code (`AdjustDungeon` and the instance's own `AdjustCell`) had cells to work on. (0163 is on `server-dat-broken-landblocks.txt` from 2026-09-19, but the server dat was rewritten on 2026-09-20 at 11:04 and that list is out of date; see the next row.) The dungeon has one entry portal weenie, 4935 "Holtburg Redoubt" (lands at 0x016301AC), and one placed exit, 4936 "Surface" at 0x016301A9, which leads to AAB1, outdoors. The run just before it, `here-0363` at 12:30:40, was in the Holtburg South academy, which the user found broken: its interior cells are not in the server dat, so it could not test this. What the log cannot show: which instance they were in at each step (a position line has no instance id), and `/instance info` before and after. | |
| 2026-09-21 | Interior statics that do not spawn (0363 to 0368, 2581) | Data | Landblocks 0363 and 0364 log a `couldn't spawn` warning for every static in their interior cells (each 20 statics and 10 generators, at 12:29:57 in the persistent world, and 0363 again at 12:30:40 for the instance), and 2581 does the same (15 statics and 6 generators, at 11:18:30 and again at 11:19:03 for the instance; see the C8 row). They include exits and shops: the academies' `Exit Portal` and `Portal to Holtburg`, vendors, doors, chests and books. A read-only probe of the server dat found the cause: the server dat has none of the interior cells that the world database puts these statics into. Its `LandblockInfo` lists 0 cells for 0363, 0364, 0365, 0366, 0367 and 0368 (the six Training Academies; the database uses 48 interior cells in 0363 and in 0364, and none exists, and the same cells are missing in the other four), it lists 5 cells for 2581 (0x0100 to 0x0104) while the database uses 14 other interior cells there (none exists), and 6678, 6679 and 667A have no `LandblockInfo` at all. For comparison 018A has all 92 of the cells the database uses, 6545 all 110, 934B all 61 and 0163 (Holtburg Redoubt, used for D5) all 35. `server-dat-broken-landblocks.txt` does not list these landblocks because its checker flags a landblock only when a cell that its own `LandblockInfo` lists is missing, and that list is out of date anyway: the server dat was rewritten on 2026-09-20 at 11:04 (it is now 361,878,528 bytes, and was 348,127,232 when the list was made on 2026-09-19), and a scan of it now (2,165 landblocks that list interior cells, 668,607 cells in all) finds no landblock with a listed cell missing, where the list had 1,855. The log has the same fact for the academy: at 12:31:18 the client asked the server for cell 0x0363012F and got `[DDD] DDD_RequestDataMessage: The server does not have the requested data on 0x0363012F | EnvCell`. So it is a mismatch between the world database and the server dat, not something that instancing or this branch caused: nothing could spawn there on any build. Older logs show the same kind of failure from before the branch: 216 lines for landblock 0138 in 2026-03 (which is on the list), and a few for town interiors such as CE94, CE95 and DA75, which look like the same thing but were not probed. | A data fix, not a code one: either get these landblocks' interior cells and their `LandblockInfo` into the server dat, from a cell dat that has them, or take the statics out of the world database. I could not check the client dat, because the game had it open, and the client had to ask the server for the academy cell, so it may lack them as well. The scan above cannot see these landblocks, because they list too few cells or none; a scan of all of `landblock_instance` against the server dat would list every landblock like this. My suggestion of the academies as ready-made dungeons for D5 was wrong. |
| 2026-09-21 | C14, C15 | Fail | Reported by another tester, not reproduced by the user yet (the report does not say which build it ran): a monster inside an instance is seen by, and attacks, characters in the persistent world, and once a persistent-world monster attacked a character who was inside an instance. The characters outside cannot attack it back, and no `[INSTANCE]` line is logged. Recreation, landblock 63D5, with the admin attackable and in god mode: the admin enters an instance and makes a monster (a Rufous Grievver, weenie 2009021), `D` enters, the admin leaves, and the admin and `A` stand in the persistent world at the same spot, within 15 m of it. For about 30 s nothing is seen and nobody is attacked. Then `D` strikes the monster, and within 1 to 2 s the admin sees it and it attacks the admin. This reproduced 4 times, after 1 hit, then 2 hits (the counts of the other two are not known). Other runs in the report: a monster went on attacking `A` after `/instance leave A` while it was attacking `A`; `A` only saw it after `A` had been inside and hit it; nothing was seen when the admin was not attackable, or when several players inside were hitting it hard; and after the instance was closed a monster that had been killed in it stayed on the outside character's screen until they logged in again. Each event has an Error line `Fixed invisible attacker on player <name>. (Landblock:... - <monster> (guid)` in the tester's log (22:25:04 on 2026-09-20; 10:02:24, 10:26:39 and 11:25:08 on 2026-09-21, and others). The cause, found by reading the code and not confirmed by a run, is in how a monster chooses a target (`Monster_Awareness.FindNextTarget`), not in physics or visibility. With the new threat system it chooses from its threat table, which holds every creature that was a visible target or hit it, and not from the targets it can see now. A player who leaves the instance stays in the table: the only things removed from it are dead creatures, a player who vanished, and the current target when it is beyond the awareness range, which is measured by position without the instance. When the monster chooses such a player, the invisible attacker fix that follows (`player.AddTrackedObject(this)`) puts the monster among that player's known and visible objects, which sends their client the monster and, through `ObjectMaint.AddVisibleObject`, puts the player among the monster's visible targets. From then on it can see and attack the player. That fits the report: a light strike leaves the outside characters, at the threat floor of 100, within half of the highest threat, so they can be chosen, and a hard fight puts them below it, so nothing is seen; a character who was never inside, or is not attackable, is never in the table; the ghost left on the outside character's screen after the close is most likely an object that the fix sent to that client and that it was never told to remove (not checked); and the same path runs the other way for a persistent-world monster and a character who entered an instance. | Fixed in `d7c6993d2` (not tested on a server yet): `FindNextTarget` drops every creature that is not in the monster's instance from the threat tables, `GetAttackTargets` skips creatures of other instances, a target chosen by the legacy tactics or kept from before that is in another instance is replaced by a visible one, the invisible attacker fix only runs for a player in the monster's own instance, and a swing or a spell that lands after its target has left the instance does nothing. C14 and C15 are new. After a rebuild, run the recreation above again: with the characters in different instances the log must have no `Fixed invisible attacker` line. |

## Appendix A. `[INSTANCE]` log lines

Expected in normal use: `Created instance N: <template> (x landblocks)`, `Deleted instance N: ...`, `Island <name>: ...` (startup).

Only when provoked on purpose: `Something asked the persistent world for landblock XXXX, which only exists in instances` (F7, D4, A6), `<name> was saved inside <template>, which only exists as an instance. Moving them to ...` (E4), `There is no ...instances.json, so there are no islands` (A2), `<path>: island 'x': <mistake>` (A4).

**Always a bug, please report with the stack trace that comes with the line:**

- `... entered cell X of instance M. That cell was looked up in the wrong instance.`
- `Cell X was looked up in the persistent world by code running for instance N.`
- `... was spawned into the persistent world by code running for instance N.`
- `... can't enter instance N at <place>, which is not part of it` and `... moved to <place>, which is not part of instance N`.
- `Landblock ... entered AddWorldObjectInternal (or RemoveWorldObjectInternal) in a cross-thread operation.`
- `Out of ephemeral static GUIDs`.
- `Fixed invisible attacker on player <name>. (Landblock:XXXX - <monster> (guid)`. It is an Error from the monster's targeting and not an `[INSTANCE]` line. It means a monster chose a player who could not see it, and showed them to each other. When the two are in different instances it is always a bug: it is how a monster ended up attacking, and being seen by, characters in another instance (C14, C15). In the persistent world it can also mean a real desync, or a player who is far away.

The `can't enter instance` line can also appear once without a bug, as an instance ends: if a generator inside it spawns in the tick between the instance being removed from the table and its landblocks being unloaded, the spawn is refused and the object destroyed (seen 2026-09-21: `HometownWatchdogGen` spawning "A passerby", 32 ms after `Deleted instance 12`). At any other time it is a bug.

## Appendix B. SQL checks (shard database)

Run 1 to 3 after every test session. The range `2146435072` to `2147483647` is `0x7FF00000` to `0x7FFFFFFF`, the ids that the statics of instances get. Nothing may ever be saved with one.

```sql
-- 1. objects saved with an id from the range for instances (expect 0)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM biota WHERE id BETWEEN 2146435072 AND 2147483647;

-- 2. anything that points at such an object (expect 0)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM biota_properties_i_i_d WHERE value BETWEEN 2146435072 AND 2147483647;

-- 3. characters saved inside an instance-only island (expect 0). 0xA9B4 is an example: use your island's landblocks
SELECT object_Id, obj_Cell_Id FROM biota_properties_position
WHERE position_Type = 1 AND (obj_Cell_Id >> 16) IN (0xA9B4);

-- 4. counts to record before and after a session
SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM biota) AS biotas,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM biota_properties_position) AS positions,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM biota_properties_i_i_d) AS iids,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM house_permission) AS house_permissions;

-- 5. a character's house (type 33 is House). Compare before and after E12
SELECT object_Id, type, value FROM biota_properties_i_i_d WHERE type = 33 AND object_Id = <character guid>;
```

To stage E4, stop the server, then: `UPDATE biota_properties_position SET obj_Cell_Id = <a cell in the island> WHERE object_Id = <character guid> AND position_Type = 1;`, and start the server. (The server caches offline characters, so restart it after the edit.)

## Appendix C. Test data

**Sample `instances.json`** (Holtburg is used because `0xA9B40019 [84 7.1 94]` is the default sanctuary, a place known to be valid. It is not instance only, so nothing changes in the persistent world. Both are in the shipped file already):

```json
{
  "islands": [
    {
      "name": "test-holtburg",
      "landblocks": [ "A9B4" ],
      "bufferRing": 1,
      "instanceOnly": false,
      "entry": { "cell": "0xA9B40019", "x": 84, "y": 7.1, "z": 94, "qz": -0.0784591, "qw": 0.996917 }
    },
    {
      "name": "test-big",
      "rectangles": [ { "from": "A8B3", "to": "AAB5" } ],
      "bufferRing": 1,
      "instanceOnly": false,
      "entry": { "cell": "0xA9B40019", "x": 84, "y": 7.1, "z": 94, "qz": -0.0784591, "qw": 0.996917 }
    }
  ]
}
```

For the instance-only tests (F7 to F9) pick a landblock **without player housing**, stand in the middle of it, run `/myloc`, and copy the cell, `x`, `y`, `z` and rotation into `entry`. Do it on the copy of the database.

**Hard-coded activation targets (for C7).** Your audit of `ace_world` found 38 weenies that name a static object by its world-database guid (`ActivationTarget`). There is one row for each, with a `/teleloc` to the activator and one to its target. For C7: `/teleloc` to the activator, then `/instance here 0`, use it, and watch its target (from a second character, or after a `/teleloc` there). If the target is in the landblock next to the activator's, use `/instance here 1` instead, so that the target is in the instance too: the lookup searches the activator's landblock and the ones next to it in the same instance, as in the persistent world. You arrive on the object's own spot, so step off it if you are stuck. The positions come from the 2026-09-19 dump of `ace_world` (`ace_world_9-19-26.sql`), not from the live database, and what is newer than the dump is marked. Try the landblocks with the most first (6545 and 6546 have 14 of the 38).

The activators that have no `/teleloc` of their own, from the dump:

- 29583, 25754 and 7432 are not placed: a generator makes them, so they do not exist until it has fired. The generator of 25754 is the static that 25753 activates, so use 25753 first. The generator of 7432 is in landblock 7211, next to its target's, so use `here 1`.
- 1034400 is made by generator 1034415, which is only placed in `C7B7` and `1AFA` to `1AFE` (a capstone dungeon and its copies), while its target is in `6049`, which is not next to them. From the code it cannot find that target, in the persistent world either: expect `couldn't find activation target` for it, which is not an instancing fault.
- 26657 and 26658 are not placed, and nothing in the generators, create lists or emotes of the dump makes them.
- 14921 to 14923 are placed once each, in `0115`, `49B8` and `F518`, none of them next to `9EB4`, and their target `79EB4007` is not in the dump at all, so they cannot reach it unless the live database has more.
- 50131 is newer than the dump (it has 37 of the 38 rows). Its target `7B095001` is in it.

To fill in the gaps from the live database:

```sql
SELECT guid, weenie_Class_Id, obj_Cell_Id, origin_X, origin_Y, origin_Z
FROM landblock_instance
WHERE guid = 0x79EB4007 OR weenie_Class_Id IN (50131, 26657, 26658);
```

**Linked children (for C8).** In the 2026-09-19 dump 1,102 doors and 686 switches have children in `landblock_instance_link`. (Generators use links for their spawn points and houses for their hooks and slumlord, which C8 does not cover.) A door, a switch and a pressure plate set each child's `ActivationTarget` to themselves when the child is made (`SetLinkProperties`), so the child is the thing a player uses: of the children of doors, 1,436 are levers or buttons and 225 are pressure plates, and of the children of switches, 653 are pressure plates. Each row below is one door or trap with one such child a few metres away, in a landblock without player housing. Do C8 like C7: `/teleloc` to the child, `/instance here 0`, use it, and watch the parent (a second `/teleloc` there, or a second character). A trap hurts. Landblock 2581 is also in the C7 table, and its door is the C7 target (guid 72581042): it has a lever from a link (below) and one from `ActivationTarget` (row 24493 above), so both can be tried on the one door.
